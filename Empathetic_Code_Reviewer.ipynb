    "**Hackathon Mission 1: Transforming Critical Feedback into Constructive Growth**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mission Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements an AI that acts as a bridge, translating raw critique into supportive, educational guidance. It transforms harsh code review comments into empathetic, constructive feedback that helps developers grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- 🧠 **Single Holistic Prompt**: One powerful API call instead of multiple requests\n",
    "- 📊 **Thematic Grouping**: Organizes feedback by themes (Performance, Readability, Best Practices)\n",
    "- 🎨 **Severity Levels**: Visual indicators (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Moderate, 🟢 Mild)\n",
    "- 🔄 **Automated Diff Generation**: Shows before/after code changes\n",
    "- 📚 **Educational Resources**: Links to relevant documentation\n",
    "- 💾 **Report Export**: Saves comprehensive Markdown reports"

    "\n",
    "### How to Run This Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: \n",
    "   - Install dependencies: `pip install openai ipywidgets`\n",
    "   - Set your OpenAI API key in the API setup cell\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - Execute all cells in order\n",
    "   - The sample data will be processed automatically\n",
    "   - View the empathetic review in beautiful Markdown format\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Reviews**:\n",
    "   - Use the interactive interface to test your own code\n",
    "   - Enter code and comments, then click the generate button\n",
    "   - Reports are automatically saved to the `reports/` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Implemented:\n",
    "- **Single Holistic Prompt**: Maximum efficiency with one API call\n",
    "- **Thematic Organization**: Groups feedback logically\n",
    "- **Visual Severity**: Color-coded importance levels\n",
    "- **Automated Diffs**: Shows exact code improvements\n",
    "- **Educational Focus**: Explains the 'why' behind suggestions\n",
    "- **Interactive Interface**: Easy testing with custom inputs\n"
