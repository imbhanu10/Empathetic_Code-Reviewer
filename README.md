```

### Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 4: Open the Notebook
- In your browser, navigate to the Jupyter interface
- Open `Empathetic_Code_Reviewer.ipynb`

### Step 5: Set Your API Key
- In the "API Key Setup" cell, uncomment and set your OpenAI API key:
```python
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
```

### Step 6: Run All Cells
- Go to `Cell` → `Run All` or run each cell individually with `Shift + Enter`

## 🎯 What Each Cell Does

1. **Setup & Dependencies**: Installs required packages and imports libraries
2. **API Key Setup**: Configures your OpenAI API key
3. **Core Implementation**: Defines the `EmpatheticCodeReviewer` class
4. **Sample Data**: Loads the mission-specified test case
5. **Pipeline Execution**: Runs the empathetic review generation
6. **Display Results**: Shows the beautiful Markdown report
7. **Save Report**: Exports the report to a file
8. **Interactive Interface**: Provides widgets for custom input
9. **Requirements Validation**: Confirms all mission aspects are covered
10. **Usage Summary**: Complete documentation and instructions

## 🎛️ Using the Interactive Interface

After running all cells, you'll see an interactive interface where you can:
- Enter your own code snippets
- Add custom review comments
- Generate empathetic reviews instantly
- Automatically save reports to the `reports/` folder

## 📁 Output Files

The notebook will create:
- `reports/` folder with timestamped Markdown reports
- `code_review_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` for sample data
- `custom_review_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` for interactive inputs

## 🏆 Mission Coverage Verification

- ✅ JSON input processing
- ✅ Positive rephrasing of feedback
- ✅ Educational explanations
- ✅ Concrete code improvements
- ✅ Markdown output format
- ✅ Contextual awareness
- ✅ Resource links
- ✅ Holistic summaries
- ✅ Thematic grouping
- ✅ Severity levels
- ✅ Automated diffs
- ✅ Educational value

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when you see:
- ✅ "OpenAI library imported successfully!"
- ✅ "EmpatheticCodeReviewer initialized successfully!"
- 🤖 "Generating empathetic feedback..."
- 🎉 "EMPATHETIC CODE REVIEW COMPLETE!"
- Beautiful Markdown-formatted report with thematic feedback
- Automated code diff showing improvements
- Saved report files in the reports folder

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues:**
- Make sure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check that the key is set correctly in the notebook

**Import Errors:**
- Run the first cell to install all dependencies
- Restart the kernel if needed: `Kernel` → `Restart`

**No Output:**
- Ensure all cells are run in order
- Check for any error messages in previous cells
